        <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions, feedback, or just want to say hello —<br> feel free to reach out to us!</p>
      
        <p>
            We're a team of three passionate developers currently studying at <strong>Grit Academy</strong>, 
            where we’re sharpening our skills in full-stack development and real-world software design. 
            Our shared drive for innovation, curiosity, 
            and collaboration brought us together to create <strong>GritSquare</strong>
          </p>
        
          <p>
            This project is part of our portfolio and learning journey, 
            allowing us to apply what we've learned in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
          </p>
        
          <p>
            We believe in the power of teamwork and good design. 
            From planning to deployment, we each brought our strengths to the table — 
            whether it was front-end interaction, logic implementation, or UX styling.
